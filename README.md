**NintendoUltraSIMGEMINIV2**

**Overview**

NintendoUltraSIMGEMINIV2 is a high-resolution 90s AI SDK emulator for the Nintendo 64. It is a low-level emulator that uses the simulators present in the Oman Archive to generate on-the-fly graphics for any syntax or prompt from the GEMINI API to NINTENDO[TM] ROM Code.

**Features**

* Emulates the original Nintendo 64 DD and programs related to N64 development
* Supports prompts to machine code
* Generates high-resolution 90s AI graphics

**Getting Started**

To get started with NintendoUltraSIMGEMINIV2, you will need to:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/FlamesCo/NintendoUltraSIMGEMINIV2.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the emulator:

```
python ultrasim.py
```

4. Type "/imagine" to pilot the program.

**Usage**

Once the emulator is running, you can use the GEMINI API to generate on-the-fly graphics. To do this, simply type in a prompt followed by the word "generate." For example, to generate a picture of a cat, you would type:

```
cat generate
```

The emulator will then generate a picture of a cat and display it on the screen.

You can also use the emulator to run N64 ROMs. To do this, simply drag and drop the ROM file onto the emulator window. The emulator will then load the ROM and start running it.
